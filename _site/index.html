Chad grew up in Northern California and has been playing soccer almost all of his life. He started coaching when he was 16 years old, taking over a local youth team as part of a high school project and also running private sessions with some of the young local talent. He worked at an indoor soccer arena all through high school and would referee and play in matches every night. He received a college scholarship to play soccer at Oregon State University where he played four years of Division 1 Soccer…</p>

He also coached Summer camps for the University every year, working with hundreds of children each Summer. After College, Chad continued his Soccer career playing professionally and semi-professionally over the last 11 years for teams here in Switzerland and also in the United States… Sacramento Republic, Portland Timbers, FC Wohlen, SR Delémont, BSC Old Boys just to name a few. In fact, it was an invite to tryout with swiss giants FC Basel that originally brought him over to Basel and started his career here in Switzerland.</p>

Whether it be in private sessions, small groups, team clinics, camps or in many other forms of training, Chad has been there and done that! He has surrounded himself with Soccer his whole life and has lived out his dream and passion of being a professional soccer player. It never came easy and there was a lot of hard work, setbacks and many obstacles and lessons to learn all along the way. But Chad made it happen. Consequently, Chad has attained a vast knowledge and experience of what it takes to succeed in Soccer.</p>

        <h2 class="f5 f4-ns lh-solid">1 On 1 Private Sessions</h2>
        <p class="lh-copy"><p>Everyone wants to compete at their best. You play on the best team, have the best gear and even workout in the gym… but so does everyone else! So how do you gain an edge? Just like a tutor in school, the most effective way to improve in sports is working 1 on 1 with a private coach who specializes in individual development. At BSA, we have years of professional playing and coaching experience and know exactly what it takes to elevate your game to the next level.</p>

<p>Because of our wide range of experience and knowledge here at BSA, we are able to, within one session, assess exactly where a player is at and develop &amp; design a training regimen that will bring them exactly where they need to go! These 1.5 hour sessions are focused primarily on player’s technical ability and development, as well as, Soccer specific athleticism, balance, coordination and all other aspects of the game. In addition to these fundamentals of the game, position specific exercises and drills are also performed during these sessions.</p>

        <h2 class="f5 f4-ns lh-solid">Small Group Sessions</h2>
        <p class="lh-copy"><p>Small groups are run very similarly to a private 1 on 1 session and are a great way to get that personalized training session feeling with a group of friends or teammates. They are, of course, by nature a little less personal than a private session, but in turn, they do not give up much customization and are a little easier for parents on the wallet! This also opens up a much wider range of training exercises and drills that are made possible with more players on the pitch. Our BSA coaches love to make these sessions intense and competitive… bringing out the best of all the players!</p>

Or those players who are on a team but need more touches on the ball and a little extra training in their week. We are very inclusive in these courses and try to take as many players as possible.
