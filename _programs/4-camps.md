Normally, offered as a week-long program during the school holidays, our Skill Camps are designed to be fun but also challenging for all players regardless of age or ability level. Our experienced and knowledgeable staff work with the players intensely every morning specifically on their fundamental technique, athleticism and their overall development as a Soccer player. Then, after a supervised lunch break, we break into match and tournament play where the players have the opportunity to show what they have learned and use their new found skills in a competitive, match-like environment.
