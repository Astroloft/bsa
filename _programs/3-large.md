These courses are specifically for those players who, for whatever reason, do not currently have a team and still want to benefit from the fun and learning experience of Soccer. Or those players who are on a team but need more touches on the ball and a little extra training in their week. We are very inclusive in these courses and try to take as many players as possible. The more the merrier! These courses focus on teaching the players the fundamentals of soccer and developing their technical abilities in a fun, positive and safe environment!
