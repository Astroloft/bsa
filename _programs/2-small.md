Small groups are run very similarly to a private 1 on 1 session and are a great way to get that personalized training session feeling with a group of friends or teammates. They are, of course, by nature a little less personal than a private session, but in turn, they do not give up much customization and are a little easier for parents on the wallet! This also opens up a much wider range of training exercises and drills that are made possible with more players on the pitch. Our BSA coaches love to make these sessions intense and competitiveâ€¦ bringing out the best of all the players!
