Everyone wants to compete at their best. You play on the best team, have the best gear and even workout in the gym… but so does everyone else! So how do you gain an edge? Just like a tutor in school, the most effective way to improve in sports is working 1 on 1 with a private coach who specializes in individual development. At BSA, we have years of professional playing and coaching experience and know exactly what it takes to elevate your game to the next level.

Because of our wide range of experience and knowledge here at BSA, we are able to, within one session, assess exactly where a player is at and develop & design a training regimen that will bring them exactly where they need to go! These 1.5 hour sessions are focused primarily on player’s technical ability and development, as well as, Soccer specific athleticism, balance, coordination and all other aspects of the game. In addition to these fundamentals of the game, position specific exercises and drills are also performed during these sessions.
