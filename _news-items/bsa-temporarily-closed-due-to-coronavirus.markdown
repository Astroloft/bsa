Hello All

It seems a bit trivial at the moment but I just wanted to give you all an update of where BSA is at right now in these difficult times for us all. We will be following the guidelines set forth by the Swiss Football Federation and the FOPH and **we will be closing our doors until April 30th (at the earliest)**… in fact, we have already been closed since last Friday but have been dealing with various issues and organising things, tying up loose ends, etc. and quite frankly, I just haven’t really had the motivation to sit down and write this letter… It is a difficult time for us all and we can and should take comfort in the fact that we are all in this together and will get through it together!

**We hope to be open again for Summer Camps** and would ask that you keep us in mind when you are deciding on what programs to sign your children up for over the Summer holidays.

I will make sure to write again when I know more about when we will re-open our doors again and under what conditions and protocols this would be possible. I will also be posting here and there on social media when I have time though, so **please follow us on Instagram, Facebook and YouTube** if you would like to see what we’re up to (see links below). Feel free also to send in any videos of your training sessions you are doing right now to keep your skills sharp or to stay fit and I will try to post them on my IG and facebook stories every other day or so. **Tag @bartlomesocceracademy for a repost! :-)**

Lastly, please listen to authorities, take care of yourselves, stay home and stay safe!

Looking forward to seeing you all on the pitch again hopefully very soon!

Thank you for your patience in reading this and all the best!

Chad and the whole BSA Staff
