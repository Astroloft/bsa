**BSA's ELITE TRAINING PROGRAM** is a one of a kind Training System developed by our highly experienced and knowledgeable coaching staff specifically for players who are serious about developing themselves as footballers and passionate about taking their game to the **NEXT LEVEL!!!**

These 1.5 hour sessions are focused primarily on playerâ€™s technical ability and development, as well as, Soccer specific athleticism, balance, coordination, reaction speed, cognitive awareness & decision making, Prehab & Regeneration and many other aspects of the game that tend to not get as much attention in a normal club/team training atmosphere.

Players will be broken up into groups of 4-6 players (depending on age and ability level) and each group will be assigned a coach. These smaller, similar-level groups will allow for a more customised and personal training session for each individual player and will help maximise each player's potential for development.

**EACH PLAYER** is allowed one **FREE TRIAL with NO OBLIGATION to join**! After the trial, register for the SPRING Course up until **APRIL 1st and receive a 10% discount**
